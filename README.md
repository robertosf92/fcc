FCC (Free Clasifier Collection) provides a set of machine learning algorithms to train, test and clasify various data inputs

Each clasifier provides 4 basic functions:

-A training function
-A testingh function
-A function that asks for the data required to clasify a data set
-A function to clasify the data set provided

There are two basic structures, both intended to provide a common interface for every clasifier in FCC the first one being for training/test only and the second one for clasifying a data set.
